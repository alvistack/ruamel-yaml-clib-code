Package: python3-ruamel.yaml.clib
Architecture: amd64
Description: C based reader/scanner and emitter for ruamel.yaml
 This package was split of from ruamel.yaml, so that ruamel.yaml can be
 build as a universal wheel. Apart from the C code seldom changing, and
 taking a long time to compile for all platforms, this allows
 installation of the .so on Linux systems under /usr/lib64/pythonX.Y
 (without a .pth file or a ruamel directory) and the Python code for
 ruamel.yaml under /usr/lib/pythonX.Y.
